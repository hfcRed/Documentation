## How to use

<Steps>
1. Define the Animator Controller that you want to use for the Automatic Repathing tool in the general settings.

   ![Automatic Settings](/src/images/animation-repathing/automatic-settings.png)

   Animator Controllers can be assigned by using an [Animator Component](/animation-repathing/settings/), a [VRChat Avatar](/animation-repathing/settings/) or the [Root Animator](/animation-repathing/settings/).
   
2. Click the refresh button to scan all Animations in your Animator Controllers for invalid property paths.

3. Input the new property path into the text field and click ``Apply`` to update the property path for all Animatons.

</Steps>

:::note

When pressing ``Apply`` the text fields of all other invalid paths will reset to their original value. Its best to update invalid paths one at a time.

## Additional Features

- You can drag and drop GameObjects from the Hierarchy into the text field to automatically fill in the property path.
