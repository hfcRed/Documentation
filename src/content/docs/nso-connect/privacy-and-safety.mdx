## About Safety

It is extremely unlikely that Nintendo will take action against any account for interfacing with their servers. Here are some points to consider:

    * People have been interfacing with NSO servers without issues ever since it was released in 2017.
    * No one has ever gotten their account or console banned or suspended for interfacing with NSO servers.
    * Nintendo has only ever taken action against one application and its users in 2023 because it was putting heavy load on their servers.
        * The accounts got their access to Splatnet 3 temporarily revoked. The accounts were not banned or suspended. The users could still play Spatoon 3 online and did not lose access to any other NSO features or services.
    * This API has very strict rate limits to make it impossible to generate more requests than you would when using the NSO app itself.
        * The rate limits can be found on the [Query Service](/nso-connect/service/query#rate-limiting) page.

### Incidents

    Subsequently, the app was taken down and the accounts that used it had their access to Splatnet 3 temporarily revoked.
    The accounts were not banned or suspended. The users could still play Spatoon 3 online and did not lose access to any other NSO features or services.
