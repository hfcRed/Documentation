## Handling 502 responses

When something goes wrong while trying to authenticate with Nintendo, you will receive a 502 response code, alongside a JSON object with information about where the process failed.
It is crucial to understand how to handle these responses correctly.

:::caution
Refrain from repeating the request with the same data until the issue is resolved!
:::

### Understanding the steps

The JSON object you receive will contain a ``step`` field inside of the ``message`` object, which will tell you more about where and why the process failed.

Some steps will contain a ``status`` field inside the ``nintendoResponse`` object, which will give you more information about the error.

* **0/7 (getting user access token)**

  The provided session token is invalid or expired. Generate a new session token and try again.

* **1/7 (getting user info)**

  This step should never fail unless something went wrong on Nintendos side. If it does, report it to me immediately.

* **2/7 (getting first fToken)**

  This step can sometimes fail if the fToken endpoint is unavailable. This is a server-side issue and should be reported to me.

  The status of the fToken API can be found on the [imink status](https://status.imink.app) website.

* **3/7 (getting web service access token)**

  * Nintendo response status ``9407``

    The account associated with the session token is not linked to a Nintendo console. This is a client-side issue and should be reported to the user.

  * Nintendo response status ``9427`` and ``9403``

    The NSO app has received an update and the version number used by the API is outdated. This is a server-side issue and should be reported to me.

* **4/7 (getting second fToken)**

  Same as step two.

* **5/7 (getting gToken)**

  * Nintendo response status ``9450``

    The account associated with the session token does not have a valid NSO membership. This is a client-side issue and should be reported to the user.

* **6/7 (getting service parameters)**

  The account associated with the session token does not own or has not used the service you are trying to query. This is a client-side issue and should be reported to the user.

* **7/7 (storing parameters)**

  Uncommon step to fail. It means something went wrong while trying to store the service parameters in the database. This is a server-side issue and should be reported to me.

  You can find out more about what, how and why the services parameters are stored on the [Parameter Storage](/nso/storage/) page.

## Rate Limiting

This endpoint enforces very strict rate limiting. This is done to prevent excessive loads on the Nintendo servers and to prevent abuse of the API.

The rate limits are set up in a way that less requests are made to the Nintendo servers than when using the NSO app itself.

* **Base limit**

  2 request every 10 seconds per session token.

* **Process limit**

  1 running process per session token.

  You can not send a new request until the previous one has finished.

* **Speed limit**

  2 seconds between every query in a request.

  When passing multiple queries in a single request, the server will wait for 2 seconds between every query.

* **Size limit**

  50 queries per request.

Despite these limits, you should still do your best to minimize the amount of requests you make to the API. Our goal is not to step on anyones toes, but to provide a service that is both useful to users and respectful to Nintendo.

:::note
It is recommended to split a query up into multiple requests if the single request would take longer than 15 seconds to complete.

Once a query is started, it can not be aborted, locking the session token for the duration of the query.
:::

## Aditional Notes

* Responses are sanitized from any links pointing at resources such as images or videos. Nintendo is not a CDN and should not be used as one.  
  If you require these resources, you can fetch them from [Leannys GitHub repository](https://github.com/Leanny/splat3) instead.

* Service parameters need to be re-regenerated every 2 hours. This will add a small delay of around 5-8 seconds. If a query is taking longer than usual, this might be the reason why.
